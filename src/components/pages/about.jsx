      <h1>Birth of CA Eagles</h1>
      In 2013, two cricketers came together to realize a dream of promoting and
      create a cricket club in the bay area. They shared a vision of grooming
      players with competitive and social stature. With expertise of cricket and
      the experience of playing at national level - cricketers Bhavani Peddada
      and Mohammed Majid started The California Eagles Cricket Club. With the
      help of cricket enthusiasts like Anshuman and Sandeep California Eagles
      played their first season in the winter of 2013 and stood 2nd in the
      standings table. Since then Eagles never looked back and always flew high.
      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      Play competitive cricket with passion, maintain excellence, discipline,
      fairness, and uphold the spirit of the game. Facilitate growth and
      development of the game in the community. Preserve and promote
      multicultural traditions of the club to ensure a strong and prosperous
      future of the game.
      <h1>Our Vision</h1>
      Promote Cricket across all communities by actively identifying and
      training young talents to play and perform with immense passion, thereby
      becoming one of the best Cricket clubs in the Bay Area.
